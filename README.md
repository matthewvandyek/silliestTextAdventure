# silliestTextAdventure

By no means complete, it's a university project that I thought I might continue and add stuff in the future. While it allows for more than one adventure, it currently only has a little puzzle inspired by Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose. Ah, also, it's in italian.

### Instructions

1. Download files in a folder, `cd` to it
2. If you don't have `make`, install it
3. `make clean && make all`
4. Open two terminals in this folder and put them side by side
5. In the first hit `./server`, in the second `./client`

You're good to go!
